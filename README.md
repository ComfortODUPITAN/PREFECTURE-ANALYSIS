# **PREFECTURE-ANALYSIS**
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key metrics across Japan’s prefectures,  highlighting disparities in life expectancy, salaries, population, and other socioeconomic indicators.

## **OVERVIEW**
This dashboard provides a comparative analysis of Japan’s prefectures across key public infrastructure and socioeconomic indicators.
It visualizes healthcare distribution, education expenses, public resources, and income levels to highlight regional disparities and development patterns.

### **Key Performance Metrics**
**Metric	Value	Description**
	49	Total number of public hospitals across all prefectures
	¥21.30	Average education spending per capita
  805	Number of registered public parks
  12,288	Total number of practicing physicians nationwide
### **Key Insights**
**Healthcare Infrastructure**
The total number of public hospitals recorded is 49, indicating limited state-run facilities compared to private or university hospitals.
Kochi Prefecture leads with 16 hospitals, followed by Tokushima (13) and Kagoshima (12), highlighting a strong healthcare presence in southern Japan.

**Ambulance Distribution**
There are 300 ambulances distributed across the prefectures.
Shimane (12) and Kochi (10) have the highest ambulance counts, suggesting proactive emergency service infrastructure in these regions.

Prefectures like Hokkaido and Iwate show lower counts, potentially reflecting geographic size and population distribution.

**Educational Institutions**
The “Prefecture by University” chart shows Tokyo (32 universities) as the top education hub, followed closely by Kanagawa (29) and Nara (26).
These regions represent Japan’s primary academic and research centers, hosting major universities and attracting both local and international students.

**Average Income per Capita**
The top five prefectures by income are:

Toyama (3.4k)

Yamaguchi (3.2k)

Yamanashi (3.2k)

Wakayama (2.9k)

Yamagata (2.9k)

Income levels are generally higher in mid-sized prefectures with balanced industry and education growth.

### **Interpretation**
The dashboard highlights strong regional disparities in both infrastructure and income:

Urban regions (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka) show concentration in education and professional workforce (physicians and universities).

Rural prefectures (Kochi, Shimane, Tokushima) lead in public hospital counts and ambulance presence, reflecting investment in community healthcare.

This contrast suggests urban centers prioritize higher education and income, while rural areas emphasize healthcare accessibility and essential services.

### **Recommendations**
Redistribute Healthcare Resources:
Increase public hospitals and ambulance units in northern and less populated prefectures to ensure equitable access.

Expand University Programs in Rural Areas:
Establish satellite campuses or partnerships to stimulate local economies and retain young talent.

Boost Income Equality:
Encourage job diversification and local industrial incentives in lower-income prefectures.

Integrate Further Data:
Add layers such as population density, hospital capacity, and GDP per prefecture to deepen insight correlations.

### **Conclusion**
The Japan Prefecture Dashboard provides an insightful overview of regional development patterns in Japan, combining education, income, and healthcare metrics to paint a holistic view of social and economic balance.
Findings emphasize the need for data-driven regional planning; ensuring equitable access to public services, educational opportunity, and income stability across all prefectures.
